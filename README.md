Sphero Macrolab Macros and Workshop Notes

Introduction
------------

The goal of this workshop is to introduce basic programming concepts to children in grades 3-8. It is my guess that those are the most appropriate grades for the macrolab application, although I suspect that older children (and adults) would also have fun. 

Max 20 children. We have children pair up to work together on problems.

Supplies
--------
10 Spheros

10 tablets or mobile devices (e.g., iPads, iPad minis, Nexus 7, Android phone, iPhone). iOS support is slightly better as of this writing, although the Android allows multiple Spheros to be paired, which could be fun for a special multi-Sphero workshop.

Install two applications on the devices:

  * Sphero
  * macrolab
 
Obstacle course supply ideas:

  * Coffee cans. Navigate Sphero around the can. Put Sphero in the can.
  * Small PVC pipes (cut into 6" lengths). Can be used for bowling.
  * Boxes. Sphero can go in and out of the box.
  * Colored masking tape to mark the start and end of an obstacle course. Can mark squares of different sizes as targets. Can also mark right angles to have Sphero move along a path
  * Tubes to drive Sphero through.
  
Macros
------
Here are the macros we use for our Sphero macrolab workshop:

 * Change Sphero's color
 * Turn back LED on
 * Make Sphero show a rainbow of colors
 * Roll Sphero forward and back
 * Roll Sphero in a square
